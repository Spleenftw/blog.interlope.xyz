## Spreading honey on the web 

I recently made the acquisition of a brand new serv... VPS. I sadly can't rack a new server in, it is FULL AS F. (24U not enough tho but it came home for free so...)

I wanted for quite some time install a honeypot somewhere (at home or on a VPS) to see what a sole machine could face. 
So here I am, playing with this big boy (which in reality is quite small but I'm not that filthy rich yet) :

**6** cores, **12GB** RAM, **100GB** SSD and an **unlimited 1GB** connexion. *boom*.

I feel like it's so powerfull I could probably run Crysis 3 at 4 fps average.

<i>=> dixit the guy having like a 40 cores 220GB RAM NVME SDS storage over 10G DAC cluster</i> but whatever, let's have some fun and putting some honey on the web.
<br>

## <u> What is a honey-pot, how does it work and why would you even do that, like, wtf ? </u>
	
So, according to the internet and most likely [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)) : 
	
``
In computer terminology, a honeypot is a computer security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or, in some manner, counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. Generally, a honeypot consists of data (for example, in a network site) that appears to be a legitimate part of the site which contains information or resources of value to attackers. It is actually isolated, monitored, and capable of blocking or analyzing the attackers. This is similar to police sting operations, colloquially known as "baiting" a suspect.
``

To put it in my own words, it's simply a trap. The metaphor of spreading honey to catch bears : you fake a system vulnerability or open ports and wait for bad guys/bots to show up and spam your fake vulnerability. 
	
Now as the reasons why you would do that, I can think of 3 :
	
- It's *fun*. Trapping bots and see them trying to run some commands or whatsoever.
-  It's *still fun*, but you can do it for reaserch reasons. What are the bots trying nowadays, which CVE are they trying, which users!passwords are they using, where do they come from (country / AS speaking) and doing stats about those logs.
- Which leads to the *most fun* part of it : **graphs**. We **love graphs**, some probably jerk off to them. Do not start pointing fingers, we're all grown adults here.


## <u> The cow that like honey </u>

I'll speak about the one I knew before starting this project : [cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie).
	
It is probably one of the most known honeypot, which is used for ssh/telnet connexion. 
Simply load it up via docker, and redirect your port 22/tcp to your cowrie host port 2222, you'll start to see things moving.

```
docker run -p 2222:2222 cowrie/cowrie:latest
```

```
interlope@guinea-pig:~$ ssh heyyoutube@10.100.40.222 -p 2222

We can see here that i tried to ssh into the machine with heyyoutube/hey and it logged it. This is nice, but we can push it.
Let's say we could create an entire fake filesystem where any password works and so we could trap the bots into a fake shell and see what they are trying to do ?

Create the folders where we will store the logs :
```bash
mkdir -p data/cowrie/{downloads,keys,log/tty}
```

Create the cowrie config to trap our bots :
```bash
cat > data/cowrie/keys/cowrie.cfg <<'EOF'
[honeypot]
hostname = srv04
log_path = log
download_path = dl

[ssh]
enabled = true
listen_endpoints = tcp:22:interface=0.0.0.0

[telnet]
enabled = true
listen_endpoints = tcp:23:interface=0.0.0.0

[output_jsonlog]
logfile = log/cowrie.json
EOF
```

Last configuration step, create the file that will accept whatever user!password combinaison :
```bash
cat > data/cowrie/keys/userdb.txt <<'EOF'
*:x:*
EOF
```

Create the docker-compose file :
```yml
services:
  cowrie:
    container_name: cowrie
    image: ghcr.io/telekom-security/cowrie:24.04.1
    restart: always
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp/cowrie:uid=2000,gid=2000
      - /tmp/cowrie/data:uid=2000,gid=2000
    ports:
      - "2222:22"
      - "2223:23"
    read_only: true
    volumes:
      - ./data/cowrie/downloads:/home/cowrie/cowrie/dl
      - ./data/cowrie/keys:/home/cowrie/cowrie/etc
      - ./data/cowrie/log:/home/cowrie/cowrie/log
      - ./data/cowrie/log/tty:/home/cowrie/cowrie/log/tty
    networks:
      - cowrie_net

networks:
  cowrie_net:
    driver: bridge
```

Fire it :
```bash
interlope@cowrie:~$ docker-compose up -d
[+] Running 1/0
 ✔ Container cowrie  Running                                                                               0.0s
```

Results :

There's a real filesystem, that allow us to create a file, read it, whatsoever. 

On the cowrie side, this is what we see : a BIG bunch of json. And do you knows what json means ? 

<u>It means it is time for **JQ** : </u>

Anyway, that's all for this playground, let's spice things up.

## <u> Tpotce </u>

Everything we've done previously was to introduce what we could call : a [Rube Goldberg machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine) AKA [tpotce](https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce)

According to their github page, T-Pot is the all in one, optionally distributed, multiarch (amd64, arm64) honeypot plattform, supporting 20+ honeypots and countless visualization options using the Elastic Stack, animated live attack maps and lots of security tools to further improve the deception experience.

It features 39 dockers running with, according to my own maths : 35. freakings 35 honeypots (including cowrie).
It runs with a sole linux command :  
``env bash -c "$(curl -sL https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce/raw/master/install.sh)"``

PS : you will probably need to stop the exim4 service (mail) that uses the port 25/tcp for everything to work flawlessly.

Did i say **graphs** ? There's plenty of graphs. There's even a LIVE ATTACK MAP, which is crazy cool to show off : 
![alt text](image.png)
<br>

There's an *ELK (Elastic, Logstash and Kibana)* stack which already have a lot of dashboards (one per honeypot at least). This one is one of the most basic, it shows a global view of the honeypot logs :
![alt text](image-1.png)

<br>

But the most important part of this dashboard is at it's end : you can have a word cloud with every user!password used. And the bigger it is, the more it has been used.
![alt text](image-2.png)

<br>

There is also a nice Suricata dashboard, which features the HTTP Content, the User Agent and HTTP Method :
![alt text](image-3.png)



This is everything for today, this article will be updated in a month or so, to get more metrics.
